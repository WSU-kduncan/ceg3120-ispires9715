#  My Project 1

To initialize a new repo use the command: 'git init NAMEHERE'
    -The difference between this and --bare is that --bare doesn't create a workspace. It's only the contents of .git folder.

To clone into a repo use the command: 'git clone ubuntu@34.196.244.29:Bobv2.git'

To set up SSH authentication for Bobv2 I copied the contents of my pub key and put it into Bobv2 authorized_keys file.
